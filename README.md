## Hi there 👋

I'm a Computational Mathematics/Computer Science student at the [https://ceps.unh.edu/](University of New Hampshire).

- I'm currently learning about the Linux System works and how to work on low-level systems.
- I'm currently working on several projects:
  - An autoconfig script similar to Omakub for Fedora Linux
  - A homelab for self-hosting most of my data/services
  - A cyberdeck build for legal hacking (I will become [https://watchdogs.fandom.com/wiki/Aiden_Pearce](Aiden Pearce))

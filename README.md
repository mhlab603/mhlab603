## Hi there 👋
I'm a Computational Mathematics/Computer Science student at the [University of New Hampshire](https://ceps.unh.edu/).

- I'm currently learning about the Linux System works and how to work on low-level systems.
- I'm currently working on several projects:
  - An autoconfig script similar to Omakub for Fedora Linux
  - A homelab for self-hosting most of my data/services
  - A cyberdeck build for legal hacking (I will become [Aiden Pearce](https://watchdogs.fandom.com/wiki/Aiden_Pearce))
